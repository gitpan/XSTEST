This is a subsystem test, I guess, with heavy emphasis on interaction bugs.
Everything, every whitespace or non-whitespace, every indent or outdent,
every this-before-that, every this-and-this-again, every this-first, every
this-last, has a purpose and many have found bugs or limitations in xsubpp.
