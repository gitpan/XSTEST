CASE:

-  ALIAS should be allowed before CASE, and only before CASE.
-  same for PROTOTYPE--maybe?
-  same for INIT--maybe?  no.
-  CLEANUP goes inside the case -- should it?
-  PROTOTYPE can be specified for each case--uses the last one

Can't use aliases and prototypes in the same function -- Inc6.xsh
