This is Dean's XS test suite.   Mar2,96

Read the README's for each suite before you run it.  Sometimes they're not
expected to make a working extension, sometimes they have failing test cases
which are documented and are waiting on xsubpp bug fixes.

In some cases these suites need my typemap, called "perlobject.map".  You'll
probably find it on CPAN in the same place you found this.  You'll have to
modify some of the Makefile.PL files in here to point at it.

These suites require Perl5.002.

XSTEST::XS1

	subsystem test for XS, emphasis is on finding interaction bugs.

XSTEST::RPCB1

	test suite for the code in the perlxs manpage

test.pl

	test suite driver, will run all of the suites.
